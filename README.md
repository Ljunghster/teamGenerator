# teamGenerator
This is a template generator for information about employees of differing responsibilities and rank. When I installed express, it had a small interference with the gitignore I think, not sure what that was about or whether it will break my homework.
Not sure what to do to make input from a user enter through javascript into an html file; however, html files should be working with http://localhost:3000.

Started to get stuck with an error in code that I was referencing because it was working before.
